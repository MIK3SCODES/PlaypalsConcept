<div class="w3-container" style="padding:128px 16px" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">WHO WE ARE</h3>
  <p class="w3-center w3-large">Playpals is an innovative internet and mobile application that's set to revolutionize non-professional sport. Imagine a real-life video game, where users can connect with each other, build bonds, and communicate with teams to conquer the Playpals space. The app is designed to bring players together, whether you're an opponent looking for someone to play against or a team seeking the required players to fill a session.

    <br> What sets us apart is our gamification element. Users will be able to gain a ranking based on their performances in the game, and venues can host sessions, charging a small service fee to the venue and players. We're confident that this will create a platform for competitive non-professional football, with users engaging with one another, building relationships, and having fun while they're at it.
    
    <br> Our goal is to create a sense of community, bringing players together and providing them with a new way to experience non-professional sport. With Playpals, you'll have access to a platform that's engaging, exciting, and fun, making it the perfect way to connect with people who share your passion for football.</p>

  <h3 class="w3-center" id="inspiration">OUR INSPIRATION</h3>
  <p class="w3-center w3-large">
    Our inspiration to start the company was based of two main events that fueled the gap. 
  </p>
  <div class="w3-row-padding">
    <div class="w3-col m6">
      <h3>Event 1 - The holiday.</h3>
      <p>"While on holiday abroad, I lost my passport and found myself stranded in a small apartment in Southern Europe. As I waited for the embassy to process my paperwork, I searched for ways to fill my days. One day, I stumbled upon a perfect astroturf football pitch, but was disappointed to find it unoccupied. Despite returning daily at different times, I couldn't find anyone to join in a game with. Initially, I assumed this was due to the country's limited technological advancements why there were no resources supporting me on this search for events held on this pitch. However, it dawned on me that if a foreigner found themselves in the same position in the UK, they too might struggle to find a local game to join. This realization inspired me to create Playpals, a platform that connects people with local sports groups and facilities, ensuring that anyone can easily find and join in on a game no matter where they are." - Our Founder, Micah David</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-col m6">
      <h3>Event 2 - The Lads chat.</h3>
      <p>"As a group of friends, we always loved bantering about who was the best football player. We'd constantly argue in our lads' group chat, with each of us convinced that we were the ultimate champ. But when we actually tried to get together for a game, it was always a struggle to organize a match. We weren't committed to joining a local team and it seemed like there were never enough players or available pitches to host a private session.
        One day, after yet another failed attempt at organizing a game, it hit me that this was a common problem for many people. This reignited my motivation to start working on Playpals, determined to create a platform that brings people together through sport. We believe that sport has the power to unite people from all walks of life, and we're excited to be bringing that vision to life through Playpals. So the next time we have an argument about who's the better footballer, we be sure to settle it on Playpals!." - Target audience, the groupchat</p>
